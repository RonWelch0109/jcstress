                The write to $b is not visible yet; we can observe whatever in $a.

            <description>
                The write to $b is observed, expected to see $a == 1.

            <description>
                The write to $b is observed, but write to $a is not. This is the counter-intuitive behavior,
                but the coding pattern is incorrect: alone "sync" barrier is not enough to get the proper
                acquire/release semantics.
